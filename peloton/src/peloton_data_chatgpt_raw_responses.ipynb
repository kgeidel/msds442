    "While many of the listed responsibilities in the specification can be addressed using multimodal LLM-based AI agents, full automation is not entirely feasible for all areas. Tasks like personalized recommendations, data-driven insights, customer support, and marketing analytics can be effectively handled with LLMs, especially when integrated with structured backend data and user inputs. However, complex workflows—such as fraud detection, secure payment handling, and nuanced customer disputes—require deterministic systems, external integrations, and possibly human oversight for reliability and compliance. Moreover, multimodal inputs (e.g., voice, image, text) add usability but also introduce challenges in accuracy, context interpretation, and system robustness. In short, LLMs can significantly augment and partially automate many features, but a hybrid approach combining AI agents with rule-based logic and human intervention is necessary for critical or high-risk functions."
